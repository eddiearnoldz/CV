# Eddie Arnold

  I am a full-stack junior developer and recent graduate from the Makers Academy bootcamp in London. Having spent the past ten years acting on stage and screen, my background in the creative arts has brought a high level of focus, problem solving and enthusiasm to my coding. I strive to create simple, effective and maleable code through team collaboration and personal development. I am looking to join a company that believes passionately in their mission and encourages personal growth while working towards a common goal. Hopefully this will involve learning new languages and frameworks to develop my skillset.

## Skills
**Fast Learner**

The Makers course has provided me with the tools to learn new ideas and concepts efficiently and thoroughly. In my previous work as an actor I had to interpret and communicate ideas and emotions over pages of dialogue in a few hours for auditions. This has helped me to quickly understand new coding languages, logic concepts and frameworks at a fast pace while fully abosrbing their meaning.

**Strong communicator**

For the past ten years I have taken other people's writing and given the audience an honest and truthful representation of the writer's world. Being able to communicate not just a thought but a feeling puts me in a great position to communicate clearly with my peers as well as interdeparmentally and on the client-side.

**Native spanish speaker**

Having a Colombian mother and growing up in South America I am fluent in Spanish and can facilitate communication between English and Spanish as a translator.

**Adaptable**

Whether it be a new coding language or a new team, I am at ease with evolving environments. Having previously worked on a project by project basis with new cast and crews at every turn I am quick to get up to speed and align my goals with the group's to ensure the highest productivity.

**Attention to detail**

From continuity in filming to punctuation in Shakespeare I have developed a keen eye for detail in both language and aesthetics. I understand the value of clarity and purpose in code is the same as in any language. This has become an invaluable skill in my coding, whether it be debugging in the back-end or designing the front-end.

**Creative**

Building detailed character studies for stage and screen has nourished my creativity. This transferable skill has encouraged me to think outside of the box when creating concepts or programs from scratch. 

## Experience

**Actor** (2011 to 2021)

Throughout my career i have had the chance to collaborate with some of the best directors in the UK and abroad, performing on stage in the West End and on Broadway, as well as acting for TV and Film around Europe.
